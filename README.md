# Mission Control Project (Work in Progress)
<p align="center">
<img id="img2" src="images/IMG_1.jpg" alt="alt text" width="600" />
</p>

This Mission Control project is a control interface for a robot controlled via a client web interface served at `http://robot-hostname.local:8000` using WebSockets. The robot hosts a server and the Mission Control, along with being a control interface, broadcasts battery gauge readings for its display and Pi via WebSockets.

ðŸ”— [Robot repo here](https://github.com/clds84/robot_app)

> A regular laptop or desktop can also be used as a client if you donâ€™t want to build Mission Control hardware.

A watch case from the brand Unimatic is used to serve as the housing for this project. It's a more niche setup to use this case versus a Pelican case, but a Unimatic watch case can be purchased online if you don't want to experiment with modifying the .stl file or work on a design from scratch for the Pelican case. However, it could give you the chance to serve your own needs and add your signature.

## Setup (Overview)

This project involves physical hardware, system services, and network setup. Use this section as a high-level checklist to guide your deployment.

1. **Assemble hardware**  
  Install and wire hardware inside 3D printed parts. Refer to [How To Build](#how-to-build) section for guidance if needed.

2. **Flash Raspberry Pi OS and configure WiFi**  
  Flash the SD card with a full OS and set up WiFi.

3. **Clone this repo and set up a virtual environment (optional)**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/clds84/mission_control_app
  cd mission_control
  ```
  (Optional):
  ``` bash
  python3 -m venv venv (optional)
  source venv/bin/activate (optiona)
  ```
4. **Install dependencies**
   > pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Copy services**

    Copy `battery_status.service` and `start_chromium.service` into `~/.config/systemd/user/` 
    
    Copy Pico folders into Picos that have been flashed with CircuitPython. For information on installing CircuitPython on a Pico, check out the tutorial on Adafruit's website.

    [Setting up Pico](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/circuitpython?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21079267614&gbraid=0AAAAADx9JvRjtoqjIYq9UEM2eLZpWssM2&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmK_CBhCEARIsAMKwcD5siCjgq94ZBptRdrNc88MBBWlfSgQVt83iIU242RNPsfV2uoISjUYaApUQEALw_wcB)

6. **Enable and start services**

    Enable and start user-level services:
    ```bash
    systemctl --user enable battery_status.service start_chromium.service
    systemctl --user start battery_status.service start_chromium.service
    ```

7. **Access the robot interface**

    This will happen as a result of the service, `start_chromium.service`, that runs opens a Chromium browser and accesses the client web interface at `http://robot-hostname.local:8000`

8. **Operate the robot**

    Us the key switches and rotary encoders as described below in [Interface Controls](#interface-controls) in order to operate the robot.

### Watch Cases:

- [Unimatic](https://www.unimaticwatches.com/utcase/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=19482995497&utm_content=&utm_term=&gadid=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=19482687050&gbraid=0AAAAADFBVhVcNUgAm4EVyVVlri3Z6knEH&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmK_CBhCEARIsAMKwcD50w9FguGeLGCXvBZO0s7XWOidrKqhi3FIC263coEC9vBCH0YQL2A4aAp1rEALw_wcB) (inner dimensions: 7.48 x 5.12 x 3.54 in) 
- [Pelican 1120](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/protector/1120/) (Inner dimensions: 7.29 x 4.78 x 3.33 in)

The Pelican is cheaper and the only drawback is having to design the .stl files but it can serve as a learning experience. The Unimatic case was laying around and was the inspiration so it was used.

## 3D Printed Parts

Included `.stl` files for:

- Large compartment
- Small compartment 

The large compartment 3D print that houses the Pi, the display, and other hardware does not initially fit well because the case's internal dimensions aren't symmetrical, so some sanding with a dremel was used in order to get the fit just right which is not too snug and not too lose. This allows sliding it in and out with slight effort in order to access the hardware if needed. This is especially useful when troubleshooting for an extended period of time where a power connection from an outlet is preferrable to not drain the LiPo. Sanding was preferred over repeated print testing because of insufficient access to a 3D printer for additional versions.

<img id="img2" src="images/IMG_2.jpg" alt="alt text" width="600" />

It's recommended to print a small sliced segment for the back and face of the parts for testing fitment before printing the entire part. 

>**Disclaimer: The .stl pieces were glued together and everything has worked great, but this poses an issue for removing the display in case it fails. It might be sufficient to snap the two halves that make up the large compartment but there is the possbility of them separating while pulling the compartment out from the case. If you want to avoid running into this or any other issues, it's recommended to use design software to include two half-moon designs with a threaded hole on an accessible part of the inside of both large compartment pieces in order to clamp them together.**

## How to Build

**Tips:**

- It's recommended to **breadboard or loosely wire** all components first to test functionality before permanent mounting. See [How to Use](#how-to-use) to make sure hardware is installed properly and the software behaves as expected.
- You may need a **conical file** to widen mounting holes on the battery gauges or multiplexer to fit standoffs.
- **Power stacking**: The PowerBoost, battery gauges, and multiplexer stack cleanly using standoffs.

### PowerBoosts
<img id="img2" src="images/IMG_6.jpg" alt="alt text" width="600" />
There are two different types of PowerBoosts in order for the JST connectors to face the midline and the USB-A to face the side opening. The PowerBoost closest to the ethernet port is the 1000 while the other is the 500. 

### PowerBoost/Battery Guage/Multiplexer stack and more
<img id="img2" src="images/IMG_5.jpg" alt="alt text" width="600" />

This image shows how the stacks are setup as well as the wiring start and endpoints. The QT stemma cable for the multiplexer to the Pi is a QT stemma connector on one end for the multiplexer and Dupont connectors on the other end (jumper wires).

> The display and Pi have separate power sources.

The image shows the PowerBoost 1000 used for the display power, but you can designate them for the opposite case. It's just a suggestion and can depend on your lipo setups. The 1000 will charge at a faster rate, 1000mA vs 500mA.

## How to Use

> Mission Control should be flashed with a full OS and a mobile hotspot shoudl be used for WiFi in order to facilitate SSH sessions for seting up the primary WiFi in that environment. Without an SSH session or a wired connection in a new environment to use Mission Control and the robot, there's no way to access the Pi's Network Manager in the shell in order to create a new WiFi connection. 

### (Optional) Use a Virtual Environment

To avoid polluting your system Python, use the following in robot_app/:

```bash
cd mission_control
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Dependencies
Install dependencies with:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Service Files - copy in user services

Copy `battery_status.service` and `start_chromium.service` into `~/.config/systemd/user/` 

> Run `update_service.sh` to keep the service files in the repo up to date with their copies in the user service directory. This only matters if you plan to change the service files and want the copies in the repo to reflect changes in the user service directory.

- Once the above steps have been completed, the robot Pi automatically runs `battery_status.py` and `start_chromium.service` at boot that opens chromium at full-screen to access the robot's client web interface at `http://robot-hostname.local:8000`. 

### Operating robot in a new environment

- Setup WiFi - this is easily done in the GUI, but if you'd like to practice setting up WiFi in the shell, please continue below:
  - Make use of WiFi script that includes `nmcli` commands. 
  - Once the WiFi script has been used, adjust WiFi priority value with `nmcli connection modify <connection_name> connection.autoconnect-priority: <number>` 
  
  > **Note:** a higher value means higher priority. This will avoid hiccups if the hotspot is still on and has a higher priority than the new WiFi connection. 

After WiFi setup on Mission Control and the robot, the robot's client web interface will be accessed at `http://robot-hostname.local:8000`. If the WiFi was setup in the GUI or through an SSH session, you can use `pkill chromium` to kill the browser and it will reopen in full screen mode because start_chromium.service will run if there's no instance of the browser running, which is `True` once you run pkill chromium. 

> **Note:** The User Interface (UI) is designed primarily for Mission Control's 7" display, so it might feel light on a laptop or desktop. There is room for improving those use cases if preferred over Mission Control, including browser click events as an alternative to key down/up events. 

### Interface Controls

> **Note:** Please refer to the [robot repo](https://github.com/clds84/robot_app) for keyboard controls for a laptop or desktop.

- **Encoder 1 (Motor Speed)** â€“ Toggle motor speed on/off and adjust speed
- **Encoder 2 (LED)** â€“ Toggle LED on/off and adjust brightness
- **Encoder 3 (Camera Pan)** â€“ Tilt camera up/down, reset camera to center position
- **Encoder 4 (Camera Tilt)** â€“ Pan camera left/right, reset camera to center position

- <kbd>W</kbd> â€“ Move robot forward
- <kbd>A</kbd> â€“ Turn robot left
- <kbd>S</kbd> â€“ Move robot in reverse
- <kbd>D</kbd> â€“ Turn robot right

---
### Code

- The Logic for the interface controls is in each pico folder's `main.py`, ex: `/mission_control/picos/pico1/main.py` 
> pico 1 includes and pico 2 includes
- The sensor readings from Mission Controlâ€™s battery gauges that are sent to the robot in real-time via WebSockets can be found in `battery_status.py`
- For LED and motor speed, there is encoder state managing logic located in `battery_status.py` passed from Pico > Mission Control > to robot. This is done in order to keep Mission Control's LED bar graph on/off state sychronized with the robot's NeoPixel on/off state. Without it, turning on the robot's NeoPixel prior to turning on Mission Control's LED bar graph would result in a desynchronized situation when pressing the LED bar graph encoder (on), resulting in the NeoPixel turning off. The state managing logic allows them to synchronize.

- For debugging or to check events in realtime, use battery_status.log that will be created in `mission_control/logs/` when services run. Make sure to uncomment lines such as: `logger.info('Current motor speeds: %s, %s', motor3Speed, motor4Speed)` in order to log output.
